      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p> After graduating college in 2017, I moved to Chicago. I lived there up until 2020. Since leaving I have realized that I miss that city a lot! The thing I miss the most about that city is the food, but I digress</p>
      
      <p> Up until now all of my jobs have been in tech. From being a data analyst at a Saas company, to becoming a Customer Success Manager for another. Throughout my journey I have developed an interest in the techincal side of things. Whether it's helping answer questions or guiding customers towards a proper solution, I always enjoy getting techincal. The more techincal I can be, the better I can assist customers.  </p>
      <p> So why join Thinkful? My end goal is to become a solution engineer. I want to be able to help customers understand the product enough to make them feel comfortable. The comfort I get from talking to someone techincal is that same type of comfort I want to be able to provide to customers. It's not always easy finding someone that can answer the techincal questions and that can be a problem. With that being said, learning how to code puts me in the best position to equip myself to become that technical resource when customers need it most. I simply enjoy helping people!  </p>

      <p> My joy for helping people extends far beyond wanting to help customers. I also enjoy being in a position where I can help team members. I consider myself the ultimate team player. If one team member is weak, then we are all weak. The better we are as individuals the better we function as a team, and I beleive that with my soul. So if you are looking for someone who enjoys helping and working with others, I am your guy! </p>
