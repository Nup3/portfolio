      <h2>
        Hey, I'm Lou
      </h2>
        <p>I am currently a Customer Success Manager at Smartsheet, living in the Metro Detroit area </p>
        <p> Some of my hobbies include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Working out</li>
        <li>Hanging With Friends</li>
        <li>Officiating baskeball</li>
      </ul>
      <p>*Fun fact, I once went viral for officiating related content. Check out the article <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/basketball-referee-videos-himself-practicing-the-many-different-ways-to-give-a-technical">here</a>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p> After graduating college in 2017, I moved to Chicago. I lived there up until 2020. Since leaving I have realized that I miss that city a lot! The thing I miss the most about that city is the food, but I digress</p>
      
      <p> Up until now all of my jobs have been in tech. From being a data analyst at a Saas company, to becoming a Customer Success Manager for another. Throughout my journey I have developed an interest in the techincal side of things. Whether it's helping answer questions or guiding customers towards a proper solution, I always enjoy getting techincal. The more techincal I can be, the better I can assist customers.  </p>
      <p> So why join Thinkful? My end goal is to become a solution engineer. I want to be able to help customers understand the product enough to make them feel comfortable. The comfort I get from talking to someone techincal is that same type of comfort I want to be able to provide to customers. It's not always easy finding someone that can answer the techincal questions and that can be a problem. With that being said, learning how to code puts me in the best position to equip myself to become that technical resource when customers need it most. I simply enjoy helping people!  </p>
